# Phishing_Websites_Detection-Continued-
A publicly available dataset  is used to perform this project .
The UCI Phishing Websites dataset is a publicly available dataset that contains features of various websites, including legitimate websites and phishing websites. 
The dataset can be used to develop and test machine learning algorithms and other techniques for detecting and preventing phishing attacks.

Description of the Dataset---------------------------------------------
The UCI Phishing Websites dataset contains a total of 11 attributes or features for each website,
including the SSL final state, domain registration length, URL of the website, presence of '@' symbol in the URL,

The dataset includes a total of 11,055 websites, with approximately 55% of them being legitimate and the rest being phishing websites.

The UCI Phishing Websites dataset can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, 
which is a popular repository of machine learning datasets. 
The dataset is available in CSV format and can be easily imported
into various machine learning tools and programming languages such as Python.
